Binary is yesterdayâ€™s news. There are many different types of people in this world: 

- those who have
- those who have not
- those who know they have
- those who know they have not
- those who do not know they have
- those who do not know they have not
- those who know that others also do not have
- those who know that others know they have also
- those who know that others do not have what they have
- those who know that others do not have what they do not have
- those who know that others do not have what they know they have
- those who know that others do not have what they do not know they have...

And so the possibilities continue, enumerable as are the grains of the sands of time.

Take a moment. Think about it. Which type are you?
